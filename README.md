# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project is intended to analyze Senate Election results using Python 3.7.6
below is the outline of steps I followed while preparing the code:
  1)Open the data file.
  2)Write down the names of all the candidates.
  3)Add a vote count for each candidate.
  4)Get the total votes for each candidate.
  5)Get the total votes cast for the election.
## Resources
  -Data source: election_results.csv
  -Software: Python 3.7.6 , Visual Studio 1.60.0
 ## Summary
 The analysis of the election results show that:
 - there were 369,711 total number of votes counted
 - votes for total of 3 candidates were counted:
      Candidate 1: Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213 votes, 23.0% of total count.

      Candidate 2: Diana DeGette: 272,892 votes, 73.8% of total count.

      Candidate 3: Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 votes, 3.1% of total count.
 - Final result: 
      the winner of the election was:
         Candidate 2: diana DeGette with 73.8 % of total votes.
 ## Challenge Overview:
In this Challenge, we will implement an algorythm within our code to prepare an audit of election data to determine which county had the highest turnout and listing the candidate names with their total votes and the percentage of the total votes. See below for results:
 ## Challenge results:
* Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

* Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

* Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

Then based on this data, our algorythm selected the candidate with highest total votes which was Diana DeGette from Denver County who had total of 272,892 votes which was 73.8 percent of total votes.

## Future Projects:
We hereby acknoledge that this code is capable to be applied for other future elections where there is a CSV file available that contains the election results.

Below is examples of how to modify this script to tailor it for future needs.
  * based on the location of the election file and it's naming, (# Add a variable to load a file from a path) should be modified to direct the program to the right location.
  * it would be possible to adjust the verbage that we display the results by changing the F String. There is the option of adding more caveat to it.
